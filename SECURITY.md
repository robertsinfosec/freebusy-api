# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred reporting method:
- [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/robertsinfosec/freebusy-api/security/advisories/new) via GitHub Security Advisories.

If that is not available in your environment, open a GitHub issue that contains **no sensitive details** and ask maintainers for a private channel.

## Supported versions
We generally support the latest code on the default branch.

## Scope
This policy covers the Worker, Durable Object rate limiter, and related build/test scripts.
