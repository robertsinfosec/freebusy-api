  version: "1.0.0"
  description: |
    Cloudflare Worker that proxies a private calendar free/busy iCal feed, strips sensitive data, and returns a
    busy window for a configurable forward window (in weeks) starting at 00:00:00 local time today. The timezone
    used for windowing and returned timestamps is controlled by the `PREFERRED_TIMEZONE` environment variable
    (example values in this spec use America/New_York). All
    responses are JSON, CORS is restricted to an allowlist configured via environment, and requests are rate
    limited via a Durable Object. No authentication is required; this spec documents behaviors, error codes, and
    response shapes in detail for integrators.

        Returns a simple JSON payload indicating the Worker is running. CORS is enforced; disallowed origins receive
        `403 forbidden_origin`. This endpoint does not fetch upstream data and is safe for uptime probes.

      summary: Retrieve merged free/busy blocks for the configured forward window
      description: |
        Fetches a private iCal free/busy feed (VFREEBUSY and VEVENT), unfolds and parses the calendar data, merges
        overlapping or adjacent busy intervals, normalizes all times to the configured `PREFERRED_TIMEZONE`, and clips
        results to the current window (00:00:00 local time today through the end of the configured forward window in weeks).
        Responses are cached for 60
        seconds to reduce upstream load. Upstream payloads larger than 1.5 MB are rejected with 502 to prevent
        resource exhaustion.

        The request is rate limited per hashed IP (using `CF-Connecting-IP` when present) via a Durable Object; if the
        limit is exceeded, `429 rate_limited` is returned. CORS is restricted to an allowlist; disallowed origins receive
        `403 forbidden_origin`. Successful responses include a build `version` field (typically `YY.MMDD.HHmm`). A feature
        flag (`FREEBUSY_ENABLED`) can disable the endpoint, returning `503 disabled`.
